## Algorithm Overview

This template matching algorithm:
1. Generates a dynamic template from the grand average, allowing for linear transformation along the time- and amplitude-axis.
2. Generates a weighting function based on the user-specified weighting window and type of weighting function.
3. Optimizes the template's fit to a subject-level ERP in order to measure latency relative to the grand average.
4. Provides outputs on subject-level latency as well as fit statistics

The method is designed to be robust against noise and waveform variability, making it suitable for a wide range of ERP studies.

## Example Workflow

Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how to use the provided tools:

1. Load your ERP data using `load` or other data import functions.
2. Define the hyperparameters such as the relevant electrode, the weighting window, the type of weighting function and whether to apply a penalty.
3. Use the template matching functions (e.g., `run_template_matching.m`) to compute latencies.
4. If needed, review the algorithm using the `review_app`.
5. Visualize and analyze the results using the provided plotting utilities.
